# netflixclone
A Netflix Clone using only HTML and CSS is a simple web project that replicates the basic layout and design of Netflix's homepage. It includes:

A navigation bar with a logo and menu items (e.g., Home, TV Shows, Movies).
A hero section featuring a large banner image and a call-to-action button (e.g., "Watch Now").
Movie/TV show carousels displayed in rows with thumbnail images.
A footer with links to social media, terms, and policies.
This project focuses purely on styling and layout, without interactivity or dynamic content, making it a great beginner-friendly exercise.
